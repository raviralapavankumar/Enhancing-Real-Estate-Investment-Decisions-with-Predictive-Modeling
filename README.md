# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Introduction

The housing market is vast and dynamic. Predicting house prices helps buyers, sellers, and investors make informed decisions. Data science enables us to analyze past trends and improve accuracy. This project utilizes machine learning on real estate data to identify key factors affecting house prices and provide valuable insights.

# Problem Statement

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict house prices accurately. By analyzing historical data, we aim to identify influential factors and enhance prediction accuracy. The insights generated will help investors and businesses make well-informed decisions.

# Data Collection and Preprocessing

We used publicly available real estate data and prepared it by:

Handling missing values (e.g., LotFrontage, MasVnrType, GarageType).

Converting categorical data into numerical form using label encoding and one-hot encoding.

Scaling numerical features to ensure uniformity across different attributes.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Through EDA, we discovered:

Strong correlations between various features and house prices.

Trends showing how location, size, and amenities influence prices.

Presence of outliers that could affect model performance.

# Feature Engineering

We created new features by:

Combining existing features to capture complex relationships.

Applying transformations to simplify data patterns.

Adding neighborhood average prices to provide contextual information.

# Model Selection and Training

We experimented with multiple machine learning models:

Linear Regression: A simple baseline model.

Decision Trees & Random Forest: Capture complex relationships.

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost): Provides high accuracy.

# Hyperparameter Tuning

We optimized model performance using grid search and random search to find the best settings and prevent overfitting.

# Model Evaluation

We evaluated models using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures accuracy.

R-squared (R2): Indicates how well the model explains price variations.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Provides an intuitive error measure.

# Feature Importance

Key factors influencing house prices:

House size (square footage, number of rooms).

Location (neighborhood and surroundings).

Nearby facilities (schools, transport, parks).

# Business Impact

Our model benefits Surprise Housing by:

Identifying profitable investment opportunities.

Understanding market trends for better pricing.

Reducing risks through data-driven insights.

# Conclusion and Next Steps

We have successfully built a model that predicts house prices. Future improvements include:

Incorporating more data (e.g., economic indicators).

Using explainable AI to enhance interpretability.

Exploring deep learning models for higher accuracy.

Our model empowers businesses to make smarter real estate decisions, ultimately increasing profitability.
