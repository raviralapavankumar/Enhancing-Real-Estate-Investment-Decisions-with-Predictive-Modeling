Project Question: How can data science empower real estate companies to strategically enter new markets, maximize revenue, and optimize investment decisions?

In this project, assume the role of a data scientist tasked with assisting a US-based housing company, Surprise Housing, as it embarks on expanding into the Australian real estate market. Your primary objective is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the actual value of potential properties, enabling the company to make informed investment choices.

Project Objective: Create a robust machine learning model capable of forecasting house prices in the Australian real estate market. This predictive tool will serve as a vital asset for Surprise Housing, aiding them in identifying prospective properties for acquisition. Furthermore, it aims to unveil the significance of variables that influence house prices and how these variables collectively describe the price of a house.

1.Data Understanding and Cleaning:

The dataset consists of 1460 entries with 81 variables.
The dataset contains missing values that need to be addressed using domain knowledge and appropriate techniques.
Both numerical and categorical variables are present, and they need to be handled accordingly.
2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conduct a thorough EDA to gain insights into the relationships between variables and the target variable (house prices).
Use data visualization techniques to uncover distributions, correlations, trends, and potential outliers.
3.Key Project Milestones: :

You have to build Machine Learning models, apply regularization and determine the optimal values of Hyper Parameters.
You need to find important features which affect the price positively or negatively.
Two datasets are being provided to you (test.csv, train.csv). You will train on the train.csv dataset and predict on the test.csv file. The “Data file.csv” and “Datadescription.txt” are enclosed with this file.
Perform proper data cleaning and text exploration. Focus on data visualization and infer details from it.
Try to infer unique patterns from the data and try to generate new features.
Use 4-5 models for training, do proper hyperparameter tuning and choose the right evaluation metrics to finalize your model.
Test your predictions on multiple metrics like MSE,R2_score,RMSE.
